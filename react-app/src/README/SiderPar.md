# Explanation of the Comments:
**Component Documentation:**

    - The comment at the top of the component explains its purpose: it represents the sidebar and contains links for navigation. It also has a toggle button to show or hide the sidebar.
State Management:

    - The useState hook is used to manage the visibility of the sidebar. The state isSidebarVisible determines whether the sidebar is visible or hidden.
**Toggle Function:**

    - The toggleSidebar function is responsible for toggling the visibility of the sidebar when the button is clicked. The state value is toggled between true (visible) and false (hidden).
**Navigation Links:**

    -Each <Link> component represents a navigation link to a different page. The FaHome, FaInfoCircle, and FaUser are icons that appear next to the links to improve UI/UX.
**Button Documentation:**

    - The button allows the user to toggle the sidebar's visibility. The text on the button changes depending on whether the sidebar is currently visible or hidden.
**Additional Notes:**
    - Make sure that the CSS file (Sidebar.css) contains the appropriate styling for the .sidebar, .visible, and .hidden classes.
    You can further enhance the functionality by adding animations or transitions when the sidebar appears or disappears.
    This should now be clear with English documentation and comments. Let me know if you need any further clarifications!
